# AI-Powered Image Wizard

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Image Wizard** is an interactive web application built using Streamlit that allows users to enhance, transform, and process images with state-of-the-art AI models. It integrates cutting-edge techniques for denoising, super-resolution, and other image adjustments, providing users with an intuitive and powerful tool for image enhancement.

## Features
### 1. **Image Denoising**
- **Model:** Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)
- **Details:** 
  - Utilizes a fine-tuned UNet model (`UNet2DModel`) and a scheduler (`DDIMScheduler`) to reduce noise in images.
  - Restores image quality by reconstructing noise-free details.
- **Pipeline:** `DDPMPipeline`

### 2. **Image Super-Resolution**
- **Model:** Enhanced Deep Residual Network for Super-Resolution (EDSR)
- **Details:**
  - Fine-tuned EDSR model with 16 residual blocks and a scaling factor of 4.
  - Enhances image resolution while preserving fine details.
- **Implementation:** EDSR loaded via custom configuration.

### 3. **Image Adjustments**
- **Adjustable Parameters:**
  - **Brightness**
  - **Sharpness**
  - **Contrast**
  - **Saturation**
  - **Color Intensity**
  - **Grayscale**
  - **Rotation**
- **Details:**
  - Uses Pythonâ€™s PIL library (`ImageEnhance`, `ImageOps`) for flexible, real-time adjustments to image properties.

## Methods and Models Used

### **A. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)**
- **How It Works:**
  - Predicts and removes noise from images using a reverse diffusion process.
  - Incorporates random noise generation and its iterative removal based on learned priors.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `torch`
  - `diffusers` (`UNet2DModel`, `DDIMScheduler`, `DDPMPipeline`)

### **B. Super-Resolution with EDSR**
- **How It Works:**
  - Leverages a deep residual network (ResNet) architecture to upscale images by learning high-frequency details.
  - Implements sub-pixel convolution for efficient image reconstruction.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Custom EDSR implementation loaded via `EDSR-PyTorch/src`.

### **C. Image Processing with PIL**
- **How It Works:**
  - Enhances specific properties of images (brightness, sharpness, etc.) using operations available in PIL.
  - Implements rotation and grayscale conversion.

## Attempted Enhancements (Inpainting and Colorization)
### **1. Inpainting (Stable Diffusion)**
- **Goal:**
  - Add a mask-based inpainting feature to allow users to remove unwanted elements or fill missing areas of an image using Stable Diffusion.
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrated the `StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline` from Hugging Face Diffusers library.
  - Enabled users to draw masks using a drawable canvas (`streamlit_drawable_canvas`) and process masked regions using the inpainting model.
- **Issues Faced:**
  - **Memory Limitations:** Running inpainting alongside other tasks (denoising and super-resolution) caused excessive memory usage.
  - **Dependency Conflicts:** The inpainting model required additional dependencies that conflicted with other parts of the pipeline.
  - **Performance:** Inpainting tasks were slow, even on systems with GPU support, making the app unresponsive during processing.

### **2. Colorization (DeOldify)**
- **Goal:**
  - Add colorization functionality using the DeOldify model to transform black-and-white images into realistic color images.
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrated the `get_image_colorizer` function from DeOldify and added a user interface to process uploaded grayscale images.
- **Issues Faced:**
  - **Dependency Conflicts:** The FastAI framework required for DeOldify conflicted with the Hugging Face Diffusers library used for other tasks.
  - **Memory Usage:** Loading all models (denoising, super-resolution, and colorization) simultaneously caused the app to exceed available system memory.
  - **Incompatibility:** PIL-based image preprocessing steps did not align seamlessly with the input requirements of the DeOldify model.

### Conclusion:
- Both inpainting and colorization tasks were **successfully implemented at a prototype level**.
- **However**, they were not included in the final app due to:
  - Excessive memory usage when running all features simultaneously.
  - Dependency conflicts between models and libraries.
  - Performance limitations when using consumer-grade GPUs or CPUs.

## User Interface

### **Input:**
- **File Upload:** Users can upload images in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` formats.
- **Crop Tool:** Users can crop the image for precise editing using `streamlit_cropper`.

### **Adjustments:**
- **Sliders for Image Properties:** 
  - Easily modify properties like brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.
- **Feature Toggles:**
  - Enable or disable denoising and super-resolution features.

### **Output:**
- Displays both the **Original Image** and the **Processed Image** side by side for comparison.
- Allows users to **download the enhanced image** in `.png` format.
